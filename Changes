0.6 2009/03/04

It's been.. uh.. 4 years. There are tickets in RT that simply don't apply to
the current codebase. Personally, I never work on this module, use it for one
small thing that never changes, and have started to really dislike programming
in perl recently. Thus I'm just going to release trunk as-is. It's got a lot
of changes. Things might break. Sorry. I dislike other people doing this,
and I dislike _me_ doing this, but I see very few other options at this point.
 
I'm putting all the code in a github repository at

http://github.com/jerakeen/bot-basicbot-pluggable

if people want to actually track what goes on. Anyone want to take B::B::P
over?

This is the "Morbus release". Why the "Morbus release"?
Quite simply because he did everything you see below.
You can chastise him for his ego at http://disobey.com/.

  - Revised documentation for Pluggable.pm and Module.pm.
  - Auth: Revised documentation, switched to admin() not said().
  - DNS: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Google:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
    - Removed deprecated Net::Google ie() and oe() methods.
    - Default language restriction set to just 'en'; removed 'fr'.
    - Removed explicit starts_at of 0, which is the default.
    - New option added: num_results (default: 3).
    - New option added: languages (default: en).
    - New option added: require_addressing (default: 1).
  - Join: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Karma:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() and seen().
    - Replaced fisher_yates with newer version from Perl 5.8.
    - Fixed a bunch of little nigglies here and there.
    - New option added: num_comments (default: 3).
    - New option added: show_givers (default: 1).
    - New option added: ignore_selfkarma (default: 1).
    - If only "karma", we assume $mess->{who} now.
    - Now understands "<botname>++" and "<botname>--";
  - Loader: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Seen:
    - Revised documentation, switched to seen() and told().
    - Echoed $who is now what the user typed, not lc'd version.
    - New option added: allow_hiding (default: 1).
  - Title: Revised documentation, switched to admin() not said().
  - Vars:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
    - Removed the check for the existence of $value on a !set. This
      check would fail whenever anyone tried to set the $value to 0,
      which makes perfect sense when you're trying to turn off a boolean'd
      feature. !unset doesn't work because that entirely deletes the 
      $variable, which means it'll be reset to the default the next
      time the module is reloaded or the bot is restarted.
  - Revised documentation for Store.pm and Store/* modules.
  - Infobot:
    - Revised all the documentation, added more examples.
    - Removed the 'ask' option; it was never actually used.
    - Renamed option 'passive_ask' to 'passive_answer'. More sense.
    - Added a small but decent list of common stopwords.
    - New option: num_results (for "search for <term>"; default 20).
    - New option: require_question ("water?" or "water"; default 1).
    - Entirely removed the "literal $object" feature.
    - New option: min_length (minimum $object length; default 3).
    - New option: max_length (maximum $object length; default 25).
    - New option: unknown_responses (random list of "No clue." responses).
    - You can now replace facts with "no, $bot, $object is..." too.
    - $who in a factoid is now replaced by $mess->{who}.
    - Stopwords were NOT being stopped on word boundaries. Fixed.
    - "no, $bot, $object is also $fact" now works for appending.
    - Added handling of "my" as in "my cat is named chloe".

0.50 2004/01/18
  - Moved Bot::BasicBot::Pluggble::Module::Base to B::B::P::Module.pm,
    and added Base.pm as an empty subclass, for neatness.
  - Documented the object store methods better.
  - Changed all core modules to use the proget get/set store methods.
  - Loader now uses the standard store system.
  - Installed shell script to run B::B::P.
  - The Infobot module can now passively learn and passively answer questions
    (without direct addressing) and you can set these options seperately.
  - The storage system is decently abstracted out, and has a
    default that does the same thing as the last one.
  - Gave the bot a default charset of utf8, because I'm a fan of utf8.
  - Utterly changed the Infobot back-end store system. Updating it will be
    a pain, I'm sorry, but the last one really sucked. Re-wrote the Infobot
    module to be _readable_, or at least slightly less nasty than before.
    
0.30
  - Improved docs.
  - Synced version number with Bot::BasicBot again.
  - Added NINJA support.
  - Moved to Module::Build-based module layout.
  - Huge docs improvement, based on feedback from people who
    clearly had no idea what I was smoking at the time.
  - Decent examples in examples/, and web page copies for people who use CPAN.
  - Removed Blog and Shout modules - Blog to be spun off
    into a seperate module, Shout was just stupid.
  - Support for loading modules from 'Modules' in cwd as well as main lib path.
  - The bot is a lot less case-sensitive. Still sensitive for loading
    modules, but all the help, etc commands are more friendly.
  - Removed 'reply' method (now in Bot::BasicBot).
  - Slight module API changes, nothing significant:
    - Added a 'tick' callback that happens every 5 seconds.
    - Added a 'reply' local method that mirrors the Bot::BasicBot reply.
    - Added a 'say' method that calls the Bot::BasicBot say.
    - Added a very simple 'tell' method for simple statements.
    - Added an 'emoted' callback that works identically to 'said'.
    - Added a 'chanjoin' callback, called when someone joins a channel.
    - Added a 'chanpart' callback, called when someone leaves a channel.
  - Module changes (other than doc improvements):
    - Auth:
      - Fixed silly bug that meant you didn't actually need to auth.
      - Smarter about ignoring things that aren't admin commands.
      - Now requires direct addressing.
    - Blog: removed. Look for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Blog.
    - Spell: Fixed a spelling mistake.
    - Infobot: Fixed annoying parser bugs. Needs to re-write whole thing soon.
    - Karma: Removed case-sensitivity in karma objects.
